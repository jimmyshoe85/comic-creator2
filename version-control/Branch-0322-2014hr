# Interactive Story Reader Module

## Overview
This update adds a fully-featured interactive story reader component to the application. The implementation allows users to explore branching narrative stories with multiple choice decision points, image displays, and an immersive reading experience.

## Key Features

### StoryReader Component
- **Hero/Cover Section**: Each page displays with a full-screen hero section showing the story title and current page title
- **Story Content**: The full narrative content displays below the hero section with proper formatting
- **Decision Points**: Interactive choices that affect the story outcome and branching narrative paths
- **Image Gallery**: Support for multiple images per page with intuitive image cycling
- **Navigation Controls**: Back button, restart capability, and clear page progression
- **Responsive Design**: Works across mobile and desktop devices
- **Debug Mode**: Optional debug panel for content verification and troubleshooting

### Story Data Processing
- Handles various story data formats including flow editor output
- Processes connections between nodes to create a traversable story graph
- Identifies special node types (endings, intro pages, etc.)
- Properly maps page numbers and navigation paths

### Dashboard Integration
- Added story testing capability accessible from the dashboard
- Projects display with thumbnails and titles for easy selection
- Seamless integration with Supabase for story storage and retrieval

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- **StoryReader.tsx**: Main story rendering and interaction component
- **StoryPage.tsx**: Container component that loads story data from Supabase
- **StoryTest.tsx**: Utility for testing JSON story files directly
- **Dashboard.tsx**: Updated to include story testing and management

### Data Flow
1. Story JSON is loaded from Supabase or file upload
2. Nodes and connections are processed into a navigable page structure
3. The correct starting page is identified (prioritizing pages with pageNumber "1")
4. User interacts with the story through the StoryReader interface
5. Navigation actions update the current page and history

## Usage Guide

### Viewing a Story
1. Select a story from the dashboard
2. The hero section appears showing the story title
3. Scroll down or click "Begin Reading" to view the story content
4. Make choices to progress through the narrative
5. Use the previous page button to revisit earlier content
6. Click restart to begin the story again

### Creating New Stories
Stories can be created in two formats:
1. Using a visual flow editor that exports JSON
2. Directly writing a JSON file following the story schema

Required structure:
- `nodes`: Array of story pages with content, decisions, and metadata
- `connections`: Defines how pages connect through decision points

### Debugging
If issues occur with story display:
1. Click the "Debug" button in the upper left corner
2. Review page metadata, content excerpts, and navigation history
3. Check that the correct starting page is loaded
4. Verify image paths and decision connections

## Future Enhancements
- Rich text formatting support
- Audio integration for ambient sounds
- Animation effects for transitions
- Saving reader progress
- Analytics for story engagement
